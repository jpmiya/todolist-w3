## Blockchain Task Manager (Ethereum + Python)

This project implements a decentralized Task Manager on Ethereum, allowing users to create, update, delete, and query tasks stored in a smart contract, with an off-chain interaction layer built in Python using Web3.py.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate skills in smart contract development, blockchain interaction, event handling, filtering, and pagination, following clean and maintainable design practices.
